**"Programming is simple. But producing good code is an art, and achieving it is a lifelong journey."**

I’m a 3d artist and a software architect.

As an artist I find myself able to create 3D models with photo-realistic textures optimized for commercial rendering and use in game engines like Unreal Engine and Unity 3D, projecting the quality of Latest Generation Games and application of internal programming algorithms for their interactivity for the entertainment industry and industrial product simulation.

As a programmer, who developed apps for iOS and Android phones natively through the Flutter framework, I bring solutions like Freelance to contribute to the vision of UI/UX design specialists, transforming your work into code optimized to maintain your vision, aesthetics and animations, along with the knowledge of API-Rest development in both Python with Flask and Django, and Javascript with Nodejs and Firebase, to achieve effective communication by creating web, mobile, desktop environments with server infrastructures.
